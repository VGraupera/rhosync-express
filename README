Rhosync Express

Rhosync Express (RE) is a simplified version of Rhosync written in Sinatra rather than Ruby on Rails. RE implements the basic functionality needed to support the ASK protocol in approximately 50 lines of Ruby code. No database is required.

To run RE

ruby rhosync.rb

For best results, I recommend running under Phusion Passenger. I have included a config.ru file for that.

RE currently is hardcoded to serve up the Wikipedia adapter. Included is a slightly simplified version of current wikipedia source adapter from rhosync. You can change RE to use your own adapter. In the future, I plan to provide a way to plug in your own adapter more easily and some configuration options.

Enjoy!
